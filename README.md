## Setup

### CloudBlue Commerce

[Follow these instructions to get a API Subscription Key](https://kb.cloud.im/support/solutions/articles/66000489946-how-to-get-cloud-marketplace-api-subscription-key).

> For more information about the CloudBlue Commerce API, please see https://apidocs.cloud.im/1.8/howto/ready.

### Onify

|Key|Name|Value|Type|Tag|Role|Description|
|---|----|-----|----|---|----|-----------|
|cloudblue_baseurl|CloudBlue Base URL|`<BASEURL>`|string|cloudblue, frontend|admin|The Base URL for the API, eg. `https://api.cloud.im/marketplace/eu`|
|cloudblue_marketplace|CloudBlue Marketplace|`<MARKETPLACE>`|string|cloudblue, frontend|admin|The short name for the commercial marketplace, eg. `se`|
|cloudblue_subscriptionkey|CloudBlue Subscription Key|`<KEY>`|password|cloudblue, frontend|admin|Subscription to API services that contains certain limits on the API usage, for example, it defines the upper limit on the number of requests your system can send per a period of time. |
|cloudblue_username|CloudBlue Username|`<USERNAME>`|string|cloudblue, frontend|admin|Username is the login name to authenticate your system.|
|cloudblue_password|CloudBlue Password|`<PASSWORD>`|password|cloudblue, frontend|admin|Password for the user|

> Note: Creating settings via admin interface add a trailing `_` in key. This is required for flow to work.

## Deploy

1. Open the BPMN diagram in Camunda Modeler.
2. Deploy the BPMN diagram (click `Deploy current diagram` and follow the steps).

## Run

This workflow should be run as a _adhoc workflow_ and can be part of another process.
Here is an example how to get a secret using a simple `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8181/api/v2/my/workflows/run/cloudblue-commerce-api-authenticate' \
  -H 'authorization: {auth-token}'
```

And here is the result:

```json
{
    "output": {
        "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzM4NCJ9..."
    },
    "status": {
        "statuskey": "complete"
    }
}
```

> You can also copy the flow elements into another flow if you want to get the same result but in another workflow without running it as a adhoc workflow.
